Complete the appropriate homework assignments before coming to the next class

## Fill in the css

Each file in the public directory of this folder includes html content that is already marked up with id and class attributes. But the style definitions are missing! Add style definitions so that each documents appears as it should. Refer to the comments in each html file for further instructions.

You should be able to complete the index.html and selectors.html files after this first lesson and perhaps the navbar.html file as well. Material required for the columns.html file will be covered in the second css lesson.

## Review css selectors and properties

Mozilla has excellent css documention. Review the properties list and make sure you understand selectors. We'll be using them with JavaScript as well.
