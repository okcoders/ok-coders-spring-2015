OK Coders: Lesson 4 Exercises
=====

For these exercises you'll be working with the files in the public directory in this folder. There is an HTML file for each section of this lesson material. Inside those file you'll find a `script` tag with additional instructions. Fill out the `script` tag with your JavaScript.

Also be sure to continue reading and working throught the exercises in Eloquent JavaScript:

## The JavaScript Console

You'll be logging to the console for all of these exercises. Every web browser has a *console* with an interactive JavaScript REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) where we can also log messages from our own JavaScript programs. For example, we can print out the value of a variable to the console. Because we can check the value of variables like this, the console helps us *debug* our programs when we run into problems.

In order to see what is being logged to the console you must have the JavaScript console open in your web browser. Refer to the following instructions for activing the console in your web browser:

## Logging to the Console

Log to the console using the `console.log()` function. We haven't learned what a function is yet, but for now all you need to know is that you can write this code on its own line in your program and that whatever expression you put between the parenthesis `( ... )` will be evaluated and printed out in the console.

For example, to log a value to the console write:

```
console.log( 5 );
```

Log a more complex expression to the console:

```
console.log( 5 + 3 < 10 );
```

You can also log variables to the console, which will print out their value:

```
var name = "Ada";
console.log( name );
```

## Exercise 1: Variables and Values

The variables.html file includes exercises to give you practice with values, expressions and variables.

## Exercise 2: Program Structure

The second set of exercises in structure.html introduces more complex statements and gives you practice with those statements and the expressions they require.
