  <h3>JavaScript Exercises: Variables and Values</h3>

  <p>
    Complete each of the following numbered exercises in the &lt;script&gt; tag.
    You'll need to view this document in a text editor and make your changes.
    Keep the console open and refresh (reload) the page after each change to see the result.

  <script type="text/javascript">

    console.log( "================= JavaScript Exercises: Variables and Values =================" );

    // Complete the following javascript exercises

    // Recall that we log to the console using the `console.log()` function.
    // Here's how we log the number `1` to the console:

    console.log( 1 );

    // We can pass any expression to the console.log function, i.e. place it between the parenthesis
    // Recall that simple values like numbers and strings are expressions.
    // 1. Log the string "Hello World" to the console:

    console.log( "hello world" );


    // We can log more complex expressions to the console
    // 2. Log the result of checking to see if 5 is less than 10. You should see `true` in the console:

    console.log( 5 < 10 );

    // We'll often deal with Boolean values in our programs, and we'll operate on them with Boolean operations
    // Boolean operations have truth tables the define the result of the operation on two Boolean values
    // We learned about the AND operation `&&` and OR operation `||` in class.
    // 3. Complete the description of the AND truth table below by logging the remaining three posibilities to the console

    console.log( "Boolean AND Truth Table:" );
    console.log( "true && true is true" );
    console.log( "true && false is false" );
    console.log( "false && true is false" );
    console.log( "false && false is false" );


    // 4. Complete the description of the OR truth table similarly:

    console.log( "Boolean OR Truth Table:" );
    console.log( "true || true is true" );
    console.log( "true || false is true" );
    console.log( "false || true is true" );
    console.log( "false || false is false" );


    // Normally we're not going to log expressions directly to the console
    // Usually we'll save the result of our expressions to variables and log those to the console
    // Recall that a variables is defined with the `var` keyword, like so:

    var foo;

    // And that we can log the value of a variable to the console just like we do any other expression:
    // console.log( foo )

    // 5. Declare a new variable called `bar` and log it to the console: What is it's value?

    var bar;
    console.log(bar);

    // We assign values to variables with the equals sign `=` 
    // 6. Declare a new variable called `hometown` and simultaneously assign the value of your hometown to it.
    // -  Log the result to the console.

    var hometown = "norman";
    console.log(hometown);

    // We'll often assign the result of a more complex expression to a variable
    // 7. Declare the variable `arithmetic` and assign the result of the expression `(5+4) * (3-9) / 2` to it

    var arithmetic = (5+4) * (3-9) / 2;
    console.log(arithmetic);

    // 8. Declare two variables `firstName` and `lastName` and assign your name to them.
    // -  Concatenate the two variables with a space between them and assign the result to a third variable, `name`
    // -  Log the result to the console:

    var firstName = "philip"
    var lastName = "dow";

    console.log( firstName + " " + lastName );

    // We can change the value of a variable after we've assigned a value to it.
    // 9. Declare a variable called `bar` and assign the number `42` to it. Log the variable
    // -  Then reassign the number `99` to it and log the variable again:

    var bar = 42;
    console.log(bar);

    bar = 99;
    console.log(bar);

    // Although JavaScript values have types underneath the hood, javascript variables do not have fixed types
    // This means we can assign one type of value to a variable and then assign another type to the same variable
    // 10. Declare a variable called `changes` and assign the number `56` to it. Log the variable
    // -   Then reassign the string "Now it's a string" to the variable and log it again:

    var changes = 56;
    console.log(changes);

    changes = "now it's a string";
    console.log(changes);

    // We'll learn about `if` statements in our next lesson, but let's see what they look like now
    // If statements let us branch our code depending on the Boolean result of an expression.
    // I've declared a `check` variable below:

    var check;

    // 11. Assign the value `true` to check and see what the if statement below logs:

    // check = true;

    // 12. Assign the value `false` to check and see what the if statement logs:

    // check = false;

    // How does this if statment behave? Why is it necessary to first see if check is undefined?
    // What happens if I comment out the outer if statement and don't see if check is undefined?
    // What happens if we assign a number or a string to check instead?

    if ( check !== undefined ) {

      if ( check == true ) {
        console.log("check is true!");
      } else {
        console.log("check is false. sad face");
      }

    }
