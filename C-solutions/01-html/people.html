    <!-- For each person, create a separate section for that individual using a div. In the div create an image on the left side of the page using the provided image link, and then to the right of the image add the individuals name using an h3 tag and the bio text in a paragraph. Finally, put the link to the individual below the paragraph. The text for the wikipedia link in every case should be 'Read more' -->

    <!-- SOLUTION: I'm using the width attribute on the img to set its size. This attribute is no longer used; we'd use css instead, but we don't know how to do that yet. I'm also using the hspace and vspace attributes to add some margin around the image. Again, we would normally use css for this. Don't use these attributes in your actual web pages. -->
