    /* 1. declare a function called hugeNumber that takes no parameters
     * return the number 2 to the 64th power
     *
     * you should use the following built-in function:
     * Math.pow()

     * print out the result of calling the function, for example:
     * console.log( hugeNumber() ) -> 18446744073709552000
     */




    /* 2. declare a function called testIt that takes one parameter,
     * the number 'x'
     *
     * if x is less than 0, print out "<x> is negative"
     * if x is equal to 0, print out "<x> is zero"
     * if x is greater than 0, print out "<x> is positive"
     * in each case, replace <x> with the actual number
     *
     * use a switch statement for your tests (refer to eloquent javascript)
     * use console.log() to print out the text from within the function
     *
     * for example:
     * testIt(-100); -> "-100 is negative"
     * testIt(0); -> "0 is zero"
     * testIt(100); -> "100 is postive"
     */




    /* 3. declare a function called addSuffix that takes two parameters, 
     * the string 'name' and the boolean 'male'
     *
     * if 'male' is true, return a string with 'Mr. ' prepended to it.
     * if 'male' is false, return a string with 'Mrs. ' prepended to it.

     * you only need string concatenation and an if statement

     * print out the result of calling the function, for example:
     * console.log( addSuffix("Philip Dow", true) ); -> "Mr. Philip Dow"
     * console.log( addSuffix("Mary Beth Havard", false) ); -> "Mrs. Mary Beth Havard"
     */




    /* 4. consider the following two functions foo and bar
     * try to understand what they are doing
     * 
     * uncomment the calls to foo below them one at a time
     * (delete the // at the front of the line, which is a single line comment)
     *
     * what happens? why? follow the control flow of the program
     * and calculate the value that each function gets as you go

     * why does the program crash on the last example?
