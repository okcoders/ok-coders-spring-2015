Preclass Preparation
====

You will need to install a few applications on your computer for this course, set up what's called your *development environment*, and create SSH keys, or *Secure Shell* keys for access to GitHub.

Instructions are provided for Macintosh and Windows computers, the two operating systems supported by this course material. If you are not familiar with the command line, expect to spend a couple hours on this.

Refer to the **00-02-mac-setup** or **00-03-win-setup** file for additional instructions depending on your computer.
