OK Coders: Lesson 2 Exercises
====

Complete all homework assignments before coming to the next class or as otherwise instructed.

## Create an express app, add static content, upload it to heroku

Create a new Express web application. Do not reuse previous express applications. The intent is to practice using the command line and creating applications from scratch quickly.

Copy all the html files from the *public* directory in this repository into the public directory of your express application. Place them directly in the public directory.

Each html file includes plain text that you should mark up with html. Refer to each html file for further instructions.

Test your application locally as you go, and upload the express application to heroku using git. You'll need to create a git repository, continually add content to it, create a heroku application, and upload to it. 

## Review the html elements

Mozilla has excellent html documention. Review the elements list, paying special attention to the new html5 elements. View the documentation for a few of the elements.

The intent is to familiarize you with Mozilla's html documentation. You may need to use elements in the future that we do not cover in class.

## Continue reviewing material on the command line and git

Two free books on the command line and on git were mentioned in class. Consider these books textbooks and study them.

- [The Linux Command Line, by William Shots](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) : Read the first four chapters by the end of the week one. Practice the material at the command line.
- [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) : Read the first two chapters by the end of the week 1oneon Getting Started and Git Basics.

## Continue learning JavaScript

We will not start JavaScript programming until the 3rd week, but you should continue learning JavaScript before then. We will use the excellent and free [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) for this class. Consider it a textbook.

Read and practice with the first four chapters by the beginning of the third week. Don't put this off! Work in small batches rather than waiting to cram at the end.

If you would like additional JavaScript practice, sign up for a free account at [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/) and begin working through their JavaScript lessons.
